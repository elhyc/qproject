# qproject 

This repository contains jupyter notebook files consisting of mini-projects completed at the Erdos institute, in the quantum computing stream.

1. The first mini-project involves implementing an oracle for Grover search applied to constrained optimization problems, based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04088.
2. The second mini-project involves implementing the oracle required for the quantum phase estimation part of Shor's algorithm (which is the "quantum part" of Shor's algorithm). It is based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205095.  The circuit construction uses a modest number of ancilla qubits, at the cost of possibly having longer circuit depth.
